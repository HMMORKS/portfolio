About Me: I am Muhammad Owais Rafiq, an ambitious and dedicated Electrical Engineering student at National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), with a strong passion for technology, embedded systems, and practical problem-solving. Currently pursuing my degree, I have consistently combined academic excellence with hands-on learning to build a solid foundation in both theoretical and applied engineering.

I have completed multiple internships in top-tier organizations including Jazz, where I worked as a Technical Operations Intern in the Technology Division, gaining valuable experience in RAN systems, microwave technologies, power systems (rectifiers, ATS, relays, generators), and field operations. Additionally, I interned as an Electrical Maintenance Intern at Faisal Movers, where I contributed to troubleshooting, maintaining, and inspecting electrical systems in large-scale transport operations. My portfolio includes several technical projects such as a Microcontroller-Based Electronic Voting Machine, 3-Channel DC Power Supply, Discrete Components based Audio Amplifier,Microstrip Tee Power Divider Using Quarter-Wave Transformer, 
Design and Implementation of Single-Phase Transformer with Multiple Taps, Multi-Range Digital Ammeter Design, 
Multilayer Coaxial Capacitor Analysis, FM Transmitter and a Hotel Reservation System using C++. I am currently expanding my skills in PCB design using KiCad, technical operations, electrial maintenance and have a keen interest in embedded systems and automation. To support my technical profile, I have also earned certifications in Project Management, Mastering C++, English for STEM, English for Business Development and English for Journalism through open MOOC platforms, enhancing my communication and documentation skills—crucial for working in multidisciplinary teams. I take pride in my strong work ethic, willingness to learn, and a problem-solving mindset. I am actively seeking opportunities that allow me to grow as a technology professional, contribute to meaningful projects, and help shape smarter and more sustainable solutions for the future.

Experience: Technical Operations Intern – Jazz (Pakistan's Leading Telecom Operator) Worked in the Technology Division with a focus on RAN systems, power systems, and field operations. Gained practical experience in understanding the function of various telecom cards (ZTE, Ericsson), microwave systems, and external alarms. Contributed to site audits, power system rectification (ATS, relays, generators), and learning configurations of rectifiers with their wattage and features. Collaborated with engineers to ensure network stability, optimize equipment performance, and maintain service quality across multiple cell sites. Electrical Maintenance Intern – Faisal Movers Assisted the engineering department in maintaining and troubleshooting electrical systems across transport units and infrastructure. Gained hands-on experience in routine inspections, diagnosing electrical faults, repairing circuits, and ensuring the operational safety of systems in buses and service stations. Worked closely with senior technicians to understand large-scale vehicle electrification and contributed to improving energy efficiency and maintenance workflows.
